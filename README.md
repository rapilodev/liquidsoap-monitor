### Audio Signal Monitoring and Visualization Tools

#### Overview
This repository contains tools for monitoring, logging, and visualizing audio signal levels in a streaming environment. The tools are primarily written in Perl and Liquidsoap, and they are designed to work together to measure, log, and visualize the RMS and peak levels of audio streams in real-time.

#### Contents

1. **`liquidsoap-monitor.pl`**:
    - A Perl script that monitors audio signal levels logged by Liquidsoap, processes the data, and generates visual plots using Gnuplot.
    - It reads log files generated by Liquidsoap, processes the RMS and peak values, and creates SVG plots representing the audio signal levels over time.
    - The script runs continuously for a specified duration, generating plots at regular intervals.

2. **`radio.liq`**:
    - A Liquidsoap script that streams audio, measures the RMS and peak levels of the input and output signals, and logs these values at regular intervals.
    - The script is designed to work with the `liquidsoap-monitor.pl` script, logging the data in a format that can be processed and visualized.
    - It also includes a basic audio processing pipeline, with a limiter applied to the audio stream.

3. **`rms-level-server.pl`**:
    - A Mojolicious-based Perl web server that serves real-time JSON data of the monitored audio levels.
    - The server reads the log files generated by `liquidsoap-monitor.pl` and provides an API endpoint (`/data`) to fetch the latest RMS and peak levels.
    - It also serves a simple HTML page (`index.html`) that visualizes the audio levels in a web browser using dynamic JavaScript.

#### Usage
- **Audio Monitoring and Plotting**: 
  - Run `radio.liq` to start streaming and logging audio signal levels.
  - Use `liquidsoap-monitor.pl` to periodically generate visual plots of the logged audio levels.

- **Real-Time Visualization**:
  - Start the `rms-level-server.pl` to serve real-time audio level data and view the visualization.

#### Requirements
- **Perl**: Required for running `liquidsoap-monitor.pl` and `rms-level-server.pl`.
- **Liquidsoap**: Required for streaming and logging audio data.
- **Gnuplot**: Required for generating SVG plots.
- **Mojolicious**: Required for running the `rms-level-server.pl`.
